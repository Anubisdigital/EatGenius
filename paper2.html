    Methods of Nutrition
  </h3>
 <p>
Nutrition is mainly made up of two parts namely;
 </p>
          <h3 style=" font-size: clamp( 1rem,5vw,20px); color: #3D6446;">
    .Heterotrophic nutrition<br> <br>.Autotrophic nutrition

  <h2 id="het" style=" font-size: clamp(1rem,6vw,40px); text-align: center;" >
    Heterotrophic Nutrition
  </h2>
  <p>
   This is the type of nutrition were organism feed on already made food <em style="color: #7D9182;">
      just like the way you can feed on yellow bananas  as it's the food you eat but you didn't make it 
      <b>
              <br>
      <br>

        It requires compounds of carbon and nitrogen to carry out heterotrophic nutrition 
      </b> </em>
            <br>
      <br>

Heterotrophic organisms include; all animals, fungi, insectivorous plants and most bacteria. 
 </p>
 <!--an image with many animals that feed through heterotrophic nutrition and background white-->
   <img src="img1.jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
<p>There are mainly 5 types of heterotrophic nutrition; </p>
<p>
<b style="text-decoration: underline;">
    Parasitism:
</b>        
<br>
<br>

This is were a living organism depends on a fellow for both food and shelter .<br><br>

Organisms of different species a parasite depends on the host for shelter and food but with out that big damage though still causing some issues like the way a tick feeds on a dog       <br>
It may not kill it right away but after some time due to the increase of the parasites and large amounts of blood being lost the dog may eventually die 
</p><br>
<br>

<b  style="text-decoration: underline;">
  Saprophytic/saprotrophic nutrition:
</b>
<br>
<br>
This a type of heterotrophic nutrition were organisms feed on dead decaying matter
 <br>
<br>
<b style=" position: absolute; left: 10%;">
 Forexample
</b>
 <br>

Mushroom<br>

 Mucor <br>

 Common bread mould. <br>
<br>
<b style="text-decoration: underline;">
 Symbiosis/Mutualism; 
</b><br>
<br>

This is a nutritional relationship between two organisms were two each has a benefit from the other but only one gains nutritionally <br>
<br>
<b>This should only take place between two different species</b> <br>
<br>

<b style="position: absolute; left: 10%;">
  Forexample
</b><br>
Fungi and algae <br>
The bacteria in the small human intestines <br>
Protozoa and ruminants. 
<br>
Egret white bird and a cow.
 <br>
<br>
<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Holozoic</b> 
 <br>
<br>
The process by which organisms take in matter (food) to be broken down into small pieces to be absorbed by the body
 <br>
<br>
This mode of nutrition is normally found in mainly free living organisms which 
have a specialized digestive tract. 
<br><br>


<details style="background-color: #BCD6B5; margin: 0;">
    <summary style="color:#1E685D; font-weight: bolder;  background-size: cover;">Simple note</summary> Herbivores; These feed entirely on plant vegetation. e.g. Cow, goat, sheep etc<br>
<br>

Carnivores; These feed on flesh e.g. lion, cat, dog. <br>
<br>

Omnivores; These feed on both plants and animals e.g. man and a hen. <br>
<br>

And these are all examples of organisms that feed through holozoic nutrition

 <h2 id="auto" style=" font-size: clamp(1rem,6vw,40px); text-align: center;" >
    Autotrophic nutrition
  </h2>
  <p>
      This is the type of nutrition were organisms make(synthesize) their own food <br><!--put here an image that has a white background and shows organisms that under go autotrophic nutrition-->
<img src="img2.jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
<br>
Such organisms are called <b>
   Autotrophs</b><br>
Autotrophs are producers because they make their own food and start the food chain <br>
<br>

<b>Examples of Autotrophic nutrition</b><br>
Photosynthesis <br>
Chemosynthesis <br>

<br>
<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Photosynthesis</b><br>
<br>

This the process by which plants make<b>(synthesize)</b> their own using sunlight <b>(radiant energy)</b>called starch <br>
<br>

<b>Examples inclube;</b><br>
All green plants, algae, photosynthetic bacteria. 
 </p>
<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Chemosynthesis </b><br>
<br>
synthesis of carbohydrate from carbon dioxide and water; limited to certain bacteria and fungi <br>

<b style=" font-size: 1.5rem; position: absolute; left: 50%; font-weight: lighter;">OR</b>
 <br><br>
Chemosynthesis: 
This is where organisms make their own food with the help of energy from specific 
chemical reactions (oxidation of various inorganic compounds).   <br>
<br><b>

Examples include; </b>
<br>

chemosynthetic bacteria.

      They are made up of one sugar unity
   </li>   <li>
       They form crystals
   </li>
   <li>
     They are reducing sugars because they change color in the <b>Benedict solution</b>
   </li>

</ul>
 <b style="text-decoration: underline;">Science facts about monosaccharides </b><br>
 The disaccharide Lactose is composed of glucose and galactose connected by a specific chemical structure called a :&beta;-glycosidic linkage.   <br>
<br>
Humans require the enzyme lactase to break this :&beta; -linkage and separate the two sugars for absorption. <br>
<br>
However, a significant portion of the world's adult population stops producing enough lactase after childhood, leading to lactose intolerance. <br>
<br>
 <b style="text-decoration: underline; color:#577153 ;">Disaccharides</b><br>
 <br>
This is a group of  carbohydrates made up of  two sugar units
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>
    Glucose +  Glucose &nbsp;  = maltose
  </li> 
  <li>
      Glucose + Galactose = Lactose
  </li>
  <li>
      Galactose + fructose = sucrose

</ul>
<b style="text-decoration: underline;">Science facts about disaccharides </b><br>

        Building Blocks: They are composed of two monosaccharide units (simple sugars) joined together.  <br>
<br>

Glycosidic Bond: The two monosaccharides are linked by a glycosidic bond (a covalent bond) formed through a process called a condensation reaction or dehydration synthesis, which releases one molecule of water (H<sub>
    2
</sub>O).
 <br>
<br>
General Formula: Their general chemical formula is typically <b style="color: green;">C<sub>12</sub>H<sub>22</sub>O<sub>11</sub> (which is C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6 </sub>+ C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6 </sub> H<sub>2O</sub>). </b>

<li> Cannot be crystallized </li>
<li>Do not change the colour of Benedict’s solution </li>
</ul>

<li> Cellulose.</li>
</ul> <b style="text-decoration: underline; color:#577153 ;">Science facts about polysaccharides</b>
 <br>
<br>

 Hyaluronic Acid: A structural polysaccharide that acts as a superb lubricant. It is a major component of the synovial fluid that cushions joints and is crucial for tissue repair.<br>
<br>

Bacterial Biofilms: Bacteria use polysaccharides to create sticky, protective layers known as biofilms (e.g., dextran forms dental plaque on your teeth).<br>
<br>

Biodegradable Materials: Because chitin and cellulose are both incredibly strong, durable, and naturally biodegradable, they are being researched extensively to create sustainable materials, including biodegradable plastics and even dissolvable surgical sutures.<br>

<ul>
    <li>
        Carbohydrates are a source of energy in which they are burnt in our bodies by the process of respiration inform of glucose
    </li><br>
<li>
    Carbohydrates are used in the storage of energy where excess glucose in animals which is converted  into glycogen, <b>
        this is stored in the liver to maintain blood sugar or in the muscles to help in movement
    </b>
    </li><br>

  Proteins
  </h2>  <img src="img4.jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
<br>
  These are organic essential compounds for building body cells  made up of amino acids  <br>
 The amino acid molecule can condense to form dipeptide; 
further condensation( dehydration synthesis) gives rise to polypeptide molecule (protein). <br>
<br>
The reaction where amino acids link is called a condensation reaction<b> (or dehydration synthesis)</b> because a molecule of water (H<sub>
    2
</sub>O) is removed for every bond formed. <br>
<br>
The reverse of condensation is<b> hydrolysis</b>, which is the process used in digestion or when you were testing non-reducing sugars!<br>
<br>

Hydrolysis breaks the peptide bond by adding a molecule of water.<br>
<br>

This is how your body breaks down  protein into individual amino acids that can be absorbed. Since there was a bond caused after the removal of of water to form a peptide bond between the amino acids <br>
<br>
<b>There are two types of amino acids namely;</b><br><b>
Essential amino acids</b><br>
  These are amino acids which can be synthesized in our bodies, meaning can only be got from the deit e.g Beef, Chicken, Eggs,Soybeans <br>
<br>
<b>Non-essential amino acids</b> <br>
These are amino acids that can be synthesized in our bodies, meaning can't be got from the diet
 <br>
<br>
<b>
  Nb;Our bodies can make proteins from ammonia to improve immune cell function and providing energy for cells in the small intestine.

 LIPIDS
  </h2>
  <br>  <img src="img6.jpg"  height="auto" width="100%"><br>

Lipids are a large group of organic compounds that hydrophobic(water fearing) and insoluble in water <br><br><marquee> Examples of lipids are  fats, oils, waxes, phospholipids, and steroids
  </marquee>
Fats provides good insulation because of its low <b>thermal(heat) conductivity </b><br
>

This is why they are so good at insulating the body 
  <br>
<br>
The lipid is stored as a <b>triglyceride,</b> which is a highly efficient, compact, and a hydrophobic(water-free) way to store energy.<br>
<br>
 Adipocytes(adipose), commonly known as fat cells, are specialized connective tissue cells whose primary function is to store energy in the form of lipids (fats). They aggregate to form adipose tissue (body fat), which is now recognized as a vital endocrine organ.<br>
<br>Glycerol forms the "backbone" to which three fatty acid molecules are attached. This is the molecule used for energy storage in fat cells.<br>
<br>
 
When the body requires energy between meals, hormones signal the fat cell to break down the stored lipids into fatty acids and glycerol, which are then released into the bloodstream to be used as fuel by other tissues.<br>
<br>
Fats differ from oils in that they are solids at room temperature whereas oils are 
liquids at room temperature (25°C).<br>

<ul>
    <li>
      They are extremely hydrophobic
    </li><li>
   They have extremely low thermal conductivity 
    </li><li>
      They have both a nonpolar (hydrophobic) tail and a polar (hydrophilic) head.

<b>
   Polar molecules are simply molecules with uneven electrical charge distribution just like how Oxygen pulls electrons much harder than hydrogen, making the oxygen side negative and the                        hydrogen sides positive. This is why water dissolves salt and sugar. and nonpolar have got evenly distributed electrical charge

When they mix, the Vitamin C chemically changes the DCPIP by donating electrons to it. This reaction transforms the blue DCPIP dye into a different, colorless chemical compound<br>
<br>
While you are slightly diluting the solution, the overwhelming factor that indicates the end of the test is the chemical consumption of the blue dye by the Vitamin C.

Water
  </h2>   Water is a compound made up of hydrogen and oxygen which is the most abundant compound in our bodies, 50% to 75% of our bodies is made up by water
   <img src="img11.jpg" height="auto" width="100%">
 Fluid from Food: About 20% of your total fluid intake typically comes from the foods you eat, especially water-rich fruits and vegetables (like melons, cucumbers, and lettuce).<br>
<br>

   Water is not a nutrient you eat for energy, but it's the absolutely critical solvent and reaction medium that allows all other nutrients (and the body itself) to function correctly. <br>
<br>
Staying properly hydrated is foundational to good nutrition and overall health.  <br>
<br><b>
   Men should take approximately 3.7 litters of water <br>

     <b>Specificty:</b>Enzymes are specific and they bind with specific substrate that can fit in their active part much more like a lock and key(Though enzymes can change shape at approach with the substrate) 
  </li> 
 <li>
    <b>Catalysis:</b>The enzyme holds the substrate in the right place needed and stressing it's chemical bonds which lowers the starting energy barrier(Transition State)for the reaction 
 </li><li>
     <b>Release and reuse</b>Once the reaction is complete the enzyme releases the <b>product</b> it then goes back to it's original shape and ready to bind with another substrate
 </li>
 </ul>
 
 <b>
     Importance of enzymes
 </b><br>
<br>

 It's mean importance is that it is a catalyst for all <b> metabolic processes </b>examples include:<ul>
     <li>
         It is essential in digestion as it breaks down food to small units
     </li><li>
         It manufactures energy for cells(ATP) 
     </li><li>
        It is essential to the  immune of our bodies
     </li><li>
         Clean up poisons (detoxification)
     </li><li>
       Allows movement(muscles) and brain signals 
     </li><li>
        Enzymes can be used to measure  glucose levels in our bodies
     </li><li>
        Detergents contain proteases (an enzyme that breaks down proteins) and lipases (an enzyme that breaks down fats)to break down food stains.
     </li>
 </ul><br>
<br>
<b>Classification of enzymes </b><br>
<br>

Enzymes are classified depending on the reaction they catalyze<ul>
  <li> <b>
  Isomerase;</b> 
 these catalyze reactions involving isomerism</li> 
<li> <b>
 Phosphorylases;</b> 
 these catalyze reactions involving addition of a phosphate </li>
<li> <b>
 Hydrogenases;</b> 
 these catalyze reactions involving addition of hydrogen. </li>
<li>  <b>
Dehydrogenase; </b> 
these catalyze reactions involving removal of hydrogen. </li>
<li> <b>
 Kinases;</b> 
 these catalyze reactions involving movement of molecules from one 
area to another. </li><li>
    <b>Carboxylases;</b> these catalyze reactions involving addition of Carbon dioxide. 
</li>
</ul>
Enzymes can also be described as intercellulars and extracellulars<br>
<br>

  <b>Intercellular enzymes</b> 
 are those that catalyze reaction inside the cell ,e.g all respiratory enzymes. <br>
<br>

 <b>
Extracellular enzymes</b> 
these are enzymes produced by the cell to catalyze reactions outside the cellenzymes ,e.g all digestive enzymes.
<br>

 <br>

 <b>
Nomenclature of enzymes </b> 

<br>

Enzymes are named by adding a suffix “ase” to their substrates. A substrate is a 
substance, which the enzyme acts upon by applying chemical stress to it's chemical bonds

 Some enzymes however retained their names they had before this convention. 
Such enzymes include  <b>
pepsin</b> 
 and <b>
 trypsin. </b> 
<br>
<br>

Sometimes the enzymes digesting carbohydrates are generally called  <b>
carbohydrases</b> 
 and those digesting proteins as  <b>
proteases</b>
